                <p class="answer">The hardest problem I encountered was being able to efficiently convert numbers into words for the cheque writer.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <h3 class="heading">Is your solution elegant/optimal/efficient?</h3> 
                <p class="answer">I managed to find an efficient solution, although it probably isn't optimal. The solution was to use arrays for the ones place, teens, tens place and hundreds, then make a function to convert up to 100. Then I made a loop that broke the number up into chunks of 3, then converted each chunk to words using the function and added the place value (hundreds, thousands, millions, etc.) onto the end, and combined it all in a string.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <h3 class="heading">What was the hardest problem you encountered that you weren't able to solve?</h3 class="heading">
                <p class="answer">The only problem I encountered that I wasn't able to solve was how to process form data, rather than just using a button to process inputs. If I used forms instead of buttons, the sites would be more friendly to mobile users or just people who like to press enter instead of clicking submit.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <h3 class="heading">What made this problem particularly difficult?</h3 class="heading">
                <p class="answer">The reason this problem was particularly difficult was because my insta-fix for every problem was cut off - I couldn't just google how to do it. This was because every time I googled how to handle HTML form data, it came up with stuff that was either unrelated or not helpful. The only stuff that would have been helpful used PHP and I don't know how to code PHP yet so I can't really use that either huh.</p>

                <h3 class="heading">How do you think the problem should be solved?</h3>
                <p class="answer">I should probably learn PHP lol</p>
