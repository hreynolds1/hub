                <h3 class="heading">What was the hardest problem you encountered that you were able to fix?</h3 class="heading">
                <p class="answer">The hardest problem I encountered was creating a line-of-sight system for Infiltrator, as that required some thinking and there wasn't anything preexisting to do it for me</p>

            <div class="question">
                <h3 class="heading">Is your solution elegant/optimal/efficient?</h3> 
                <p class="answer">I managed to make the line of sight system by, for once, actually using stuff I learned in maths. I used a formula to get the equation for the line between two points, then made the points on said line into an array, and checked each point's corresponding grid element for a collission. This worked really compactly and efficiently, considering what the task at hand was.</p>

                <p class="answer">The hardest problem I encountered was figuring out how to make my website look better than Patrick's to flex on him.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <h3 class="heading">What made this problem particularly difficult?</h3 class="heading">
                <p class="answer">The reason this was tricky was because every time I made my website look better Patrick decided to flex a little harder so I had to flex a bit harder and so on and so forth</p>
